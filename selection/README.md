# Selection Sorting Algorithm

## Introduction

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element, progressively growing the sorted portion of the list. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is generally considered inefficient for large lists.
